I want to add a new document description","fields are defined in the glossary.  The description is not the actual pdf, it is a short text description as in the example. For a document there are some fields that are optional or can be changed over time: issuance date can be changed or can be less precise (don't have day or month), type and connection are always there (one document is connected to at least one other), language and pages are optional (some documents could be images) and description is mandatory. Coordinates are optional in the case of documents referring to an area and not specific point"
